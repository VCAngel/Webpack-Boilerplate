# create-webpack-app

> Boilerplate for webpack based applications. 

## Available stacks

- MERN: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
- MEVN: MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node.js
- that's it for now :]

## Usage

---
### **Using npx**

To select the desired stack, pass the stack as an option flag in the **`npx`** command.

#### *MERN*

```bash
npx @vcangel/create-webpack-app <project-name> --mern
```

#### *MEVN*

```bash
npx @vcangel/create-webpack-app <project-name> --mevn
```


The app structure will be automatically generated, and you're ready to code!

---
### **Using git**

You can use `git clone` aswell if you wish. To copy a boilerplate via **git**, do the following:

#### *MERN*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VCAngel/MERN-app.git project-name
cd project-name
npm i -D
```

#### *MEVN*

```javascript
TODO
```

---

## NPM scripts

### **Developing** the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will launch on development mode in your configured port.

### **Building** the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Webpack will bundle the code in a dist folder.

### **Starting** the app:

```bash
npm run start
```
Starts the application once it's bundled.

## Why this?

Idk, but it works for me :]

**Hope it works for you aswell!**
